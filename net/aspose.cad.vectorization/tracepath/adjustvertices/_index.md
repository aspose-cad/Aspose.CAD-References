## TracePath.AdjustVertices method

Adjust vertices of optimal polygon: calculate the intersection of the two "optimal" line segments, then move it into the unit square if it lies outside. Return 1 with errno set on error; 0 on success. calculate "optimal" point-slope representation for each line segment.

```csharp
public void AdjustVertices()
```
