## PropertyPath enumeration

The name of the node's TRS property to animate, or the weights of the Morph Targets it instantiates. For the translation property, the values that are provided by the sampler are the translation along the X, Y, and Z axes. For the rotation property, the values are a quaternion in the order (x, y, z, w), where w is the scalar. For the scale property, the values are the scaling factors along the X, Y, and Z axes.

```csharp
public enum PropertyPath
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| translation | `0` |  |
| rotation | `1` |  |
| scale | `2` |  |
| weights | `3` |  |
