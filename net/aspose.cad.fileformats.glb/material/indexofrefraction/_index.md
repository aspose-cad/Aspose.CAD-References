## Material.IndexOfRefraction property

Gets or sets the index of refraction.

```csharp
public float IndexOfRefraction { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The index of refraction (IOR) is a measured physical number usually in the range between 1 and 2 that determines how much the path of light is bent, or refracted, when entering a material. It also influences the ratio between reflected and transmitted light, calculated from the Fresnel equations.

This property backs KHR_Materials_IOR extension.
