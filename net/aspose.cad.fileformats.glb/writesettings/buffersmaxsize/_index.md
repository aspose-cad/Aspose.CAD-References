## WriteSettings.BuffersMaxSize property

Gets or sets the size used to split all the resources into individual buffers.

```csharp
public int BuffersMaxSize { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

It only has an effect when these conditions are met:

[`MergeBuffers`](../mergebuffers/) must be true.

Output format must be glTF, not GLB
