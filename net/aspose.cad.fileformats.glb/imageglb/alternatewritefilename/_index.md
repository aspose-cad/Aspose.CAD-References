## ImageGlb.AlternateWriteFileName property

When set to a FileName or a relative File Path, it will be used as the file name of the texture being written. When null, a default file name will be used.

```csharp
public string AlternateWriteFileName { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

if not sure about the image extension, using .* as extension will replace the extension with the appropiate one at the time of writing.

For more advanced scenarios, you can also use: [`ImageWriteCallback`](../../writesettings/imagewritecallback/)
