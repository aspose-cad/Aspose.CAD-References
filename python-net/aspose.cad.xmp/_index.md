The namespace contains XMP related helper classes and methods.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`IXmlValue`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/ixmlvalue) | Converts xmp values to the XML string representation. |
| [`LangAlt`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/langalt) | Represents XMP Language Alternative. |
| [`Namespaces`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/namespaces) | Contains namespaces used in RDF document. |
| [`XmpArray`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmparray) | Represents Xmp Array in [`XmpPackage`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmppackage). TODO: Array may contain complex data. |
| [`XmpArrayHelper`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmparrayhelper) | The helper class for processing RDF logic |
| [`XmpElementBase`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmpelementbase) | Represents base xmp element contains attributes. |
| [`XmpHeaderPi`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmpheaderpi) | Represents XMP header processing instruction. |
| [`XmpMeta`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmpmeta) | Represents xmpmeta. Optional.<br/>The purpose of this element is to identify XMP metadata within general XML text that might contain other non-XMP uses of RDF. |
| [`XmpPackage`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmppackage) | Represents base abstraction for XMP package. |
| [`XmpPackageBaseCollection`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmppackagebasecollection) | Represents collection of [`XmpPackage`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmppackage). |
| [`XmpPacketWrapper`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmppacketwrapper) | Contains serialized xmp package including header and trailer. |
| [`XmpRdfRoot`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmprdfroot) | Represents rdf:RDF element.<br/>A single XMP packet shall be serialized using a single rdf:RDF XML element. The rdf:RDF element content shall consist of only zero or more rdf:Description elements. |
| [`XmpTrailerPi`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmptrailerpi) | Represents XMP trailer processing instruction. |


### Enumerations
| Enumeration | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`XmpArrayType`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmparraytype) | Represents array type in [`XmpArray`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.xmp/xmparray). |
