## DataStreamSupporter class

The data stream container.



**Inheritance:** [`DataStreamSupporter`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter) → 
[`DisposableObject`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/disposableobject)



The DataStreamSupporter type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [disposed](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/disposed) | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is disposed. |
| [data_stream_container](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/data_stream_container) | Gets the object's data stream. |
| [is_cached](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/is_cached) | Gets a value indicating whether object's data is cached currently and no data reading is required. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [save](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/save/#) | Saves the object's data to the current [`DataStreamSupporter`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter). |
| [save](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/save/#io.RawIOBase) | Saves the object's data to the specified stream. |
| [save](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/save/#str) | Saves the object's data to the specified file location. |
| [save](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/save/#str-bool) | Saves the object's data to the specified file location. |
| [cache_data](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter/cache_data/#) | Caches the data and ensures no additional data loading will be performed from the underlying [`DataStreamSupporter.data_stream_container`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/datastreamsupporter#data_stream_container). |
