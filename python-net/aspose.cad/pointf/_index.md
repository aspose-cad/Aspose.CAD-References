## PointF class

Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.



The PointF type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/__init__/#float-float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) structure with the specified coordinates. |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of PointF |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [empty](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/empty) | Gets a new instance of the [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) structure that has [`PointF.x`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf#x) and [`PointF.y`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf#y) values set to zero. |
| [is_empty](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/is_empty) | Gets a value indicating whether this [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) is empty. |
| [x](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/x) | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf). |
| [y](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/y) | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf). |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [add](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/add/#aspose.cad.PointF-aspose.cad.Size) | Translates a given [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) by the specified [`Size`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/size). |
| [add](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/add/#aspose.cad.PointF-aspose.cad.SizeF) | Translates a given [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) by a specified [`SizeF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/sizef). |
| [subtract](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/subtract/#aspose.cad.PointF-aspose.cad.Size) | Translates a [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) by the negative of a specified size. |
| [subtract](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf/subtract/#aspose.cad.PointF-aspose.cad.SizeF) | Translates a [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) by the negative of a specified size. |
