## StringTrimming enumeration

Specifies how to trim characters from a string that does not completely fit into a layout shape.



The StringTrimming type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NONE | Specifies no trimming. |
| CHARACTER | Specifies that the text is trimmed to the nearest character. |
| WORD | Specifies that text is trimmed to the nearest word. |
| ELLIPSIS_CHARACTER | Specifies that the text is trimmed to the nearest character, and an ellipsis is inserted at the end of a trimmed line. |
| ELLIPSIS_WORD | Specifies that text is trimmed to the nearest word, and an ellipsis is inserted at the end of a trimmed line. |
| ELLIPSIS_PATH | The center is removed from trimmed lines and replaced by an ellipsis. The algorithm keeps as much of the last slash-delimited segment of the line as possible. |
