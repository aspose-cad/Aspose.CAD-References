This constant indicates that the transform defined by this object
performs an arbitrary conversion of the input coordinates.
If this transform can be classified by any of the above constants,
the type will either be the constant TypeIdentity or a
combination of the appropriate flag bits for the various coordinate
conversions that this transform performs.
