## InterpolationMode enumeration

The [`InterpolationMode`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/interpolationmode) enumeration specifies the algorithm that is used when images are scaled or rotated.



The InterpolationMode type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| INVALID | Invalid interpolation mode. |
| DEFAULT | Specifies default mode. |
| LOW | Specifies low quality interpolation. |
| HIGH | Specifies high quality interpolation. |
| BILINEAR | Specifies bilinear interpolation. No prefiltering is done. This mode is not suitable for shrinking an image below 50 percent of its original size. |
| BICUBIC | Specifies bicubic interpolation. No prefiltering is done. This mode is not suitable for shrinking an image below 25 percent of its original size. |
| NEAREST_NEIGHBOR | Specifies nearest-neighbor interpolation. |
| HIGH_QUALITY_BILINEAR | Specifies high-quality, bilinear interpolation. Prefiltering is performed to ensure high-quality shrinking. |
| HIGH_QUALITY_BICUBIC | Specifies high-quality, bicubic interpolation. Prefiltering is performed to ensure high-quality shrinking. This mode produces the highest quality transformed images. |
