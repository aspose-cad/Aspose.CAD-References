## from_points {#aspose.cad.PointF-aspose.cad.PointF}

Creates a new [`Rectangle`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/rectangle) from two points specified. Two verticles of the created [`Rectangle`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/rectangle) will be equal to the passed `point1` and `point2`. These would be typically the opposite vertices.


### Returns 


A newly created [`Rectangle`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/rectangle).


```python
def from_points(self, point1, point2):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| point1 | [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) | The first [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) for the new rectangle. |
| point2 | [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) | The second [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) for the new rectangle. |
