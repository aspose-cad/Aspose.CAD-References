## Point class

Represents an ordered pair of integer x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.



The Point type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/__init__/#int-int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) structure with the specified coordinates. |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/__init__/#aspose.cad.Size) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) structure from the [`Size`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/size) structure. |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/__init__/#int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) structure using coordinates specified by an integer value. |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of Point |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [empty](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/empty) | Gets a new instance of the [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) structure that has [`Point.x`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point#x) and [`Point.y`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point#y) values set to zero. |
| [is_empty](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/is_empty) | Gets a value indicating whether this [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) is empty. |
| [x](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/x) | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point). |
| [y](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/y) | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point). |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [offset](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/offset/#aspose.cad.Point) | Translates this [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) by the specified [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point). |
| [offset](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/offset/#int-int) | Translates this [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) by the specified amount. |
| [add](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/add/#aspose.cad.Point-aspose.cad.Size) | Adds the specified [`Size`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/size) to the specified [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point). |
| [subtract](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/subtract/#aspose.cad.Point-aspose.cad.Size) | Returns the result of subtracting specified [`Size`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/size) from the specified [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point). |
| [ceiling](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/ceiling/#aspose.cad.PointF) | Converts the specified [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) to a [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) by rounding the values of the [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) to the next higher integer values. |
| [round](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/round/#aspose.cad.PointF) | Converts the specified [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) to a [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) object by rounding the [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) values to the nearest integer. |
| [truncate](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point/truncate/#aspose.cad.PointF) | Converts the specified [`PointF`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/pointf) to a [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point) by truncating the values of the [`Point`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/point). |
