## horizontal_resolution property


Gets or sets the horizontal resolution, in pixels per inch, of this [`RasterImage`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/rasterimage).

### Remarks 


Note by default this value is always 96 since different platforms cannot return the screen resolution. You may consider using the SetResolution method for updating both resolution values in single call.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def horizontal_resolution(self):
    ...
@horizontal_resolution.setter
def horizontal_resolution(self, value):
    ...
```
