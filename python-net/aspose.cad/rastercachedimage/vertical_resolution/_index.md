## vertical_resolution property


Gets or sets the vertical resolution, in pixels per inch, of this [`RasterImage`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad/rasterimage).

### Remarks 


Note by default this value is always 96 since different platforms cannot return the screen resolution. You may consider using the SetResolution method for updating both resolution values in single call.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def vertical_resolution(self):
    ...
@vertical_resolution.setter
def vertical_resolution(self, value):
    ...
```
