## TiffStreamWriter class

Tiff stream writer.



The TiffStreamWriter type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.tiff.filemanagement/tiffstreamwriter/__init__/#aspose.cad.StreamContainer) | Initializes a new instance of the [`TiffStreamWriter`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.tiff.filemanagement/tiffstreamwriter) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [sync_root](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.tiff.filemanagement/tiffstreamwriter/sync_root) | Gets an object that can be used to synchronize access to the synchronized resource. |
| [position](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.tiff.filemanagement/tiffstreamwriter/position) | Gets or sets the stream position. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
