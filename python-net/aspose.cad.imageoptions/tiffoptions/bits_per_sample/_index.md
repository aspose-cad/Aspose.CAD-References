## bits_per_sample property


Gets or sets the bits per sample.

### Remarks 


When setting this value keep in mind that it will also set SamplesPerPixel value to array length. These 2 properties are very tightly coupled so may be set alltogether only.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def bits_per_sample(self):
    ...
@bits_per_sample.setter
def bits_per_sample(self, value):
    ...
```
