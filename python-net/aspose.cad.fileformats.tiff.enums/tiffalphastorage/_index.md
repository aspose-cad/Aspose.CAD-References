## TiffAlphaStorage enumeration

Specifies the alpha storage for tiff documents.



The TiffAlphaStorage type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| UNSPECIFIED | The alpha is not specified and stored in the tiff file. |
| ASSOCIATED | The alpha value is stored in premultiplied form. When alpha is restored there may be some rounding effects and restored value may be different from the original. |
| UNASSOCIATED | The alpha value is stored in unassociated form. That means that alpha restored is exactly the same as it was stored to the tiff. |
