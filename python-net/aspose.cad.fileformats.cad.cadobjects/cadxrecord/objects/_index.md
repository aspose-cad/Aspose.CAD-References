Gets or sets the objects.
Xrecord objects are used to store and manage arbitrary data. They are composed
of DXF group codes with �normal object� groups(that is, non-xdata group
codes), ranging from 1 through 369 for supported ranges.This object is similar
in concept to xdata but is not limited by size or order.
